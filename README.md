# Image Handler Application using Spring Boot, Kotlin, and Java

This document outlines the roadmap for implementing an image handler application using Spring Boot, Kotlin, and Java. The application aims to store, manipulate, and retrieve images efficiently.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Questionnaire for Defining Implementations

1. **What is the main goal of the image handling system?**
   - [x] Storing and displaying images for end-users.
   - [x] Applying image manipulation operations (resizing, filters, etc.).
   - [x] Integration with other systems requiring access to images.

2. **How are images provided to the system?**
   - [x] User uploads via web interface/API.
   - [ ] Automatic import from other systems or devices.
   - [ ] Images are generated by the system itself (e.g., charts or reports).

3. **What image manipulation operations are required?**
   - [x] Image resizing.
   - [ ] Rotation or mirroring of images.
   - [ ] Applying filters (e.g., grayscale, sepia).
   - [x] Watermarking or overlaying text.
   - [ ] Other operations specific to use case.

4. **How are images accessed and displayed to users?**
   - [x] Display on web pages or mobile apps.
   - [ ] Direct download of images.
   - [ ] Need for access control or user-based restrictions.

5. **What is the expected volume of images in the system?**
   - [x] Low (hundreds to thousands).
   - [ ] Medium (tens of thousands).
   - [ ] High (hundreds of thousands or more).

6. **Are there specific performance requirements for the system?**
   - [ ] Image manipulation operations should be fast.
   - [ ] Retrieval and display of images should be optimized for low latency.
   - [x] No specific performance requirements.

7. **How will the system be hosted and managed?**
   - [ ] On-premise environment.
   - [ ] Cloud (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
   - [ ] Other (specify).

### Suggested Implementation Roadmap

1. **Storage and Retrieval of Images:**
   - Implement methods to store and retrieve compressed images in the database.
   - Use JPA (Java Persistence API) to manage image entities and database operations.

2. **Image Manipulation Operations:**
   - Integrate libraries for operations like resizing, rotation, applying filters, etc.
   - Example libraries: Java Advanced Imaging (JAI), ImageMagick, Kotlin Imaging.

3. **Image Caching:**
   - Implement a caching mechanism (using Spring Cache, for example) to cache images retrieved from the database.
   - This improves performance by avoiding frequent database retrievals.

4. **Security and Access Control:**
   - Implement access control to ensure only authorized users can view or manipulate images.
   - Use Spring Security for managing authentication and authorization.

5. **Testing and Refactoring:**
   - Write unit tests for image-related business logic (storage, retrieval, manipulation).
   - Refactor as needed to ensure clean and maintainable code.

6. **Performance Improvements:**
   - Optimize database queries, considering indexes and configuration adjustments.
   - Evaluate system scalability to handle large volumes of images, if applicable.

7. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
   - Implement monitoring metrics to track system performance and usage.
   - Configure alerts for performance or availability issues.

8. **Continuous Integration and Deployment:**
   - Set up continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipelines to automate testing and deployments of new versions of the system.
